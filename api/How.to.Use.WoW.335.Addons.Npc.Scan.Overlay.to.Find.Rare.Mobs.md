## How to Install WoW 3.3.5 Addons Npc Scan Overlay
 
Before you can use Npc Scan Overlay, you need to have Npc Scan installed first. You can download both addons from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/npcscan) or use a client like [WowUp](https://www.wowup.io/) to manage your addons. Make sure you download the versions that are compatible with WoW 3.3.5.
 
Once you have downloaded the addons, extract them to your WoW folder, usually located at C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns. You should see two folders named \_NPCScan and \_NPCScan.Overlay inside the AddOns folder.
 
Launch WoW and log in to your character. You should see a message in your chat window saying that Npc Scan and Npc Scan Overlay are loaded. You can also check your addon list by pressing Esc and clicking on AddOns.

Npc Scan Overlay works automatically once you install it. It will detect the zone you are in and display the overlay on your map. You can open your map by pressing M or clicking on the minimap icon.
 
The overlay will show different colors for different types of rare mobs:
 
- Red: Rare mobs that are part of an achievement, such as [Frostbitten](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2257/frostbitten) or [Bloody Rare](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=1312/bloody-rare).
- Blue: Rare mobs that are not part of an achievement, but still have a unique loot table or model.
- Green: Rare mobs that are tameable by hunters.
- Yellow: Rare mobs that are part of a quest or event.

You can hover your mouse over the overlay to see the name and level of the rare mob. You can also right-click on the overlay to open a menu with more options, such as:

- Show/Hide: You can toggle the visibility of the overlay on your map.
- Clear Cache: You can clear the cache of Npc Scan, which stores the information of rare mobs you have already seen or killed. This will reset the alert system of Npc Scan and allow you to see the same rare mob again.
- Modules: You can enable or disable the overlay for different map addons, such as TomTom, Carbonite, or Blizzard's default map.
- Options: You can access the settings of Npc Scan Overlay, where you can customize the appearance and behavior of the overlay.
