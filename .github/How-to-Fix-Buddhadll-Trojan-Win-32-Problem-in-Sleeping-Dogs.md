## What is buddha.dll?
 
Buddha.dll is a dynamic link library file that is part of the Sleeping Dogs v1.8 update released by SKiDROW, a group of hackers who crack and distribute games illegally. The update includes a hot fix and some new content for the game[^1^]. The buddha.dll file is responsible for bypassing the game's protection and allowing it to run without a valid license.
 
## Why is buddha.dll flagged as a virus?
 
Some antivirus programs may detect buddha.dll as a Trojan Win 32 virus because it modifies the game's code and tries to access other files and processes on your computer. This behavior is typical of malware that can harm your system or steal your data. However, in this case, buddha.dll is not malicious and only serves to crack the game.
 
However, this does not mean that buddha.dll is safe to use. Downloading cracked games from unofficial sources can expose your computer to other viruses and malware that may be hidden in the files or on the websites. Moreover, cracking games is illegal and unethical, as it violates the intellectual property rights of the developers and publishers who created the game.
 
## How to fix buddha.dll problem?
 
The best way to fix buddha.dll problem is to uninstall Sleeping Dogs and download it from an official source, such as Steam or Origin. This way, you can enjoy the game without any errors or viruses, and also support the developers who made it.
 
If you still want to play Sleeping Dogs with the SKiDROW crack, you can try the following steps:
 
1. Download buddha.dll from a trusted source, such as [DLLme.com](https://www.dllme.com/dll/files/buddha). Make sure you scan the file with your antivirus program before using it[^3^].
2. Unpack the Sleeping Dogs v1.8 update from SKiDROW and run Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update.exe to install it[^1^].
3. Copy the cracked buddha.dll file from DLLme.com to the main install folder of Sleeping Dogs and overwrite the original file[^1^].
4. Block the game in your firewall and mark the cracked buddha.dll file as secure/trusted in your antivirus program[^1^].
5. Use Launcher.exe, included with the cracked content, to set the language of your choice[^1^].
6. Play the game.

Note: These steps may not work for all antivirus programs or versions of Sleeping Dogs. Use them at your own risk.
 
## Conclusion
 
Buddha.dll is a file that cracks Sleeping Dogs v1.8 update released by SKiDROW. Some antivirus programs may flag it as a Trojan Win 32 virus, but it is not malicious by itself. However, downloading cracked games from unofficial sources can be dangerous and illegal. The best way to fix buddha.dll problem is to uninstall Sleeping Dogs and download it from an official source.
